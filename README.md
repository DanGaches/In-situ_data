The code employed for filtering the Helio4Cast ICME catalogue (found at https://www.helioforecast.space/icmecat) to identify CMEs detected by spacecraft after August 2018 and directed along the Sun-Earth line incorporates Sunpy and Fido for data retrieval and visualisation.

Additionally, the code records the positions of the spacecraft upon detection of the selected CMEs.
